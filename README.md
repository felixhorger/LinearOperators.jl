# LinearOperators.jl
Small and incomplete yet quite useful algebra system for linear operators.

You might want to have a look at [`LinearMaps.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/LinearMaps.jl) and
[`LinearMapsAA.jl`](https://github.com/JeffFessler/LinearMapsAA.jl) which are similar and more complete in several regards,
but didn't suit my purposes at the time.

If you use my package, please leave a star! Your appreciation is my motivation.
If my code helps you with your research, please cite it as follows:
